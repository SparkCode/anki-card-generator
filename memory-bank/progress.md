# Anki Card Generator - Progress

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialized on March 10, 2025
- Initial assessment of project structure and architecture completed
- Detailed analysis of CardDisplay.js component functionality
- Created flowchart of Anki card rendering process
- No active development tasks in progress yet

## What Works
From analysis of project structure and the CardDisplay.js component:

### Core Application Features
- React frontend with component-based architecture
- Integration with Anki via AnkiConnect API
- Integration with OpenRouter for AI-generated content
- Hybrid storage system:
  - LocalStorage for text data, references, and configuration
  - IndexedDB for binary audio data with metadata

### Card Display and Editing
- Parsing of AI-generated content into front/back card parts
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting for code
- Inline editing capability for both front and back content
- Copy to clipboard functionality for card content
- Card regeneration option when results are unsatisfactory
- Direct integration with Anki UI for card creation

### Audio and Pronunciation Features
- Example sentence extraction from generated content
- Text-to-speech (TTS) for example sentences
- Dictionary-based pronunciation audio (US/UK variants)
- Audio preview directly in the card display interface
- Storage of audio references in localStorage for reuse

### Storage Implementation
- Efficient storage architecture with appropriate technology for each data type:
  - Text-based data (API keys, preferences, chat history) in localStorage
  - Binary audio data (TTS audio blobs) in IndexedDB
  - Temporary playback references as blob URLs
- Automatic cleanup system for old audio files (after 30 days)
- Normalized text keys for reliable audio storage and retrieval
- Structured storage access through utility functions and service classes

## What's Left to Build/Improve
Based on analysis of CardDisplay.js and other files, potential improvements include:

### Content Generation and Parsing
- More robust parsing of AI-generated content (current regex approach may be fragile)
- Better handling of malformed AI responses
- Clearer specifications for expected AI output format
- Improved example sentence extraction

### Audio and TTS
- More reliable TTS generation for various languages
- Better error handling for audio playback issues
- Enhanced audio quality control
- Persistent audio storage beyond browser session limitations

### UX Improvements
- Improved feedback during card loading and generation
- Enhanced editing experience with suggestions or auto-completion
- Better mobile responsiveness for the card editing interface
- Visual indicators for pronunciation quality or confidence

### Technical Enhancements
- Enhanced error handling for API connections
- Additional card templates for different learning scenarios
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple cards
- Alternative connection methods for Anki (documented in CORS-FIX.md)
- More efficient localStorage usage to avoid storage limits

## Known Issues
Based on documentation and code analysis:
- Potential CORS issues with Anki connection (CORS-FIX.md suggests workarounds exist)
- Security considerations for API key storage
- Possible reliability issues with Anki connection requiring proxy solution
- Blob URLs for audio are only valid within the current browser session
- LocalStorage limitations may affect audio storage capacity
- Regex-based content parsing may break with certain AI response formats
- TTS generation may have inconsistent results based on the example sentence

## Current Milestones
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Detailed review of CardDisplay.js component
- ⬜ Review remaining components and services
- ✅ Card rendering process visualization
- ⬜ Complete feature assessment
- ⬜ UX evaluation
- ⬜ Security audit
- ⬜ Performance optimization

## Metrics & Success Indicators
- Application successfully connects to Anki
- Cards are generated using AI and added to selected decks
- User preferences are saved between sessions
- Error handling gracefully manages connection issues
- Successful TTS generation for example sentences
- Accurate pronunciation data retrieval and playback
- Card editing maintains formatting and structure
- AI-generated content properly parses into front/back components

## Next Steps
1. Complete the review of remaining source code components
2. Analyze AI generation prompt templates and response handling
3. Document the audio generation and storage workflow in detail
4. Create comprehensive flowcharts for all major application processes
5. Test error handling for various failure scenarios
6. Assess localStorage usage patterns and optimize storage
7. Identify opportunities for improved content parsing robustness
8. Prioritize enhancements based on user impact and technical complexity
