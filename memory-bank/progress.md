# Anki Card Generator - Progress

## Current Status
- Memory bank initialized on March 10, 2025
- Initial assessment of project structure and architecture completed
- No active development tasks in progress yet

## What Works
From project structure analysis, the application appears to have:
- React frontend with component-based architecture
- Integration with Anki via AnkiConnect API
- Integration with OpenRouter for AI-generated content
- LocalStorage for user preferences and configuration

## What's Left to Build/Improve
Without detailed code analysis or specific requirements, potential improvements could include:
- Enhanced error handling for API connections
- Improved UX for card creation workflow
- Additional card templates for different learning scenarios
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple cards
- Alternative connection methods for Anki (documented in CORS-FIX.md)

## Known Issues
Based on documentation and file structure:
- Potential CORS issues with Anki connection (CORS-FIX.md suggests workarounds exist)
- Security considerations for API key storage
- Possible reliability issues with Anki connection requiring proxy solution

## Current Milestones
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ⬜ Detailed code review
- ⬜ Feature assessment
- ⬜ UX evaluation
- ⬜ Security audit
- ⬜ Performance optimization

## Metrics & Success Indicators
- Application successfully connects to Anki
- Cards are generated using AI and added to selected decks
- User preferences are saved between sessions
- Error handling gracefully manages connection issues

## Next Steps
1. Review source code to understand current implementation details
2. Identify specific points of improvement in the codebase
3. Test current functionality to identify user experience bottlenecks
4. Prioritize enhancements based on user impact and technical complexity
